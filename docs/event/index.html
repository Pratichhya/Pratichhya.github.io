                <p>Orientation session was conducted on the 1st week of our master program. It was dedicated to
                  introduce ourself, the structure of curriculum and student life at CDE partner universities. Lectures
                  were provided on Career development; planning and design of each module; structuring of documents
                  according to media and target audience; introduction to licenced software and tools and; elementary
                  research design and professional ethics.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It was a fun week, as we "second batch of CDE" shared our personal and professional experiences. We
                  were 15 people from 13 different countries around the world. Despite the fact that some of us were
                  unable to physically be present in the room due to the pandemic, we were all virtually connected.
                  However, 11 of us were able to enjoy Salzburg before its second lockdown and attend few weeks of
                  classes in physical mode. This marked the beginning of a new chapter in our lives.</p>

              <ul>
                <p>This course covered the full workflow from image acquisition (new sensor types and devices), over
                  advanced pre-processing and pre-classification techniques, and object-based image understanding
                  including quality assessment.
                </p>
                <p>At the end of the course, I acquired knowledge on earth observation and its application, especially
                  in the context of the Copernicus programme. I was familiarized with advance methods, analysis tools
                  and techniques for tackling real-world scenarios with remotely sensed imagery. For the first time, I
                  learned more about OBIA (Object-Based Image Analysis), as a part of this course. It broadened my
                  vision of Knowledge-Based Classification and Class Modeling. The following are just a handful of the
                  numerous topics covered in this course:</p>

              <ul>
                <p>This was a seminar course in which participants were given the option of selecting and performing
                  analysis and modelling on a specific topic using remotely sensed data. The seminar was divided into 4
                  different phase: Image acquisition, pre-processing, image analysis and cloud processing.
                </p>
                <p>At the end of the course, I was more familiarized with spatial analysis tools and techniques. I
                  receive an improved understanding of the availability, suitability, and applicability of tools and
                  analytical methods in the field of Earth observation with a focus on remote sensing and image analysis
                  techniques. Though my chosen topic was machine learning, I equally learned Image tasking of very
                  high-resolution imagery; in-depth understanding on radiometric and top of atmospheric correction;
                  clear differentiation on DSM and DEM; multi-resolution segmentation and knowledge-based classification
                  on Sen2cube datacube; CNN with geospatial flavour; Dynamic time wrapping and processing in GEE. </p>
                <p>In order to complete the assigned task, I gave a <a
                    href="https://Pratichhya.github.io/documents/rs_analysis.pdf" target="blank">presentation</a> and
                  submitted a <a href="https://Pratichhya.github.io/documents/rs_analysispaper.pdf"

              <ul>
                <p>The course work for this topic was divided in two different module: one covering the theoritical part
                  and the other was more focused on the practical sessions.
                </p>
                <p>The session imparted a basic understanding of software engineering fundamental principles, notably
                  their connections to proven geographic methodologies and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). A
                  particular focus is dedicated to object-oriented programming with Java and web-based technologies for
                  geographic applications.
                  From this course I learned simple aspects of software engineering in the context of geoinformatics
                  domain. With this course I used JAVA programming language for the first time and maybe since I was
                  familiar with few other programming, it was handy for me. Though handy but still new and very useful
                  for me for working with spatial data and databases. As part of the practical session, I teamed up with
                  Eike Blomeier and Ella Christie to design a JAVA program for Visualizing Tweets in Google Earth Pro.

                <p>The course provided the knowledge that enabled us to read and implement geospatial data models based
                  on standardized techniques. Here, Geospatial Data Models were disscussed as the foundation of
                  efficient geospatial data processing since it impacts service interfaces, performance and the ability
                  to flexibly exchange data. Starting from a quick review of modeling basics, it included discussions
                  and hands on experiences in UML, GML and the General Feature Model.</p>

                  With a focus on spatial awareness and literacy, for effective operations in humanitarian action
                  geospatial technologies are considered as a crucial ingredients. This course was introduced as a
                  seminar session where Geospatial tools, including web and field mapping, Earth browsers and VGIs, VHR
                  satellite data and drones, were participants along with the mentor discussed their potential for the
                  humanitarian action. With the completion of the course I was able to link causes and traits of
                  humanitarian emergencies with the potential of geospatial monitoring capabilities. I understood
                  opportunities and challenges of latest geospatial technology in humanitarian action.
                </p>
                <p>As my seminar paper I presented on the topic, "EO*GI in Local Risk and Vulnerability Assessment".</p>
                <p>With the state of art technologies, individuals have been able to collect, analyzing and using
                  complex spatial data to help countries in dealing with the local and national challenges like natural
                  hazards. With the use of Earth observation sensors to collect spatial data of the Earth's surface,
                  which are then modelled with several geospatial tools to obtain information on the probability of
                  damage and potential danger of the location or situation (mostly without physical presence). These
                  tasks help decision-makers to implement efficient decision for further actions to be effective in
                  saving potential damage to life and infrastructure.

              <ul>
                <p>The course dealed with the theory of cartographic communication, principles of map design, methods
                  for preparing thematic maps, and examples for the application of thematic cartography in various
                  subject areas. The course was designed around several projects. The projects cover selected topics of
                  geovisualization and thematic cartography ranging from thematic mapping, to web-based mapping and
                  additional forms of representation in cartography. The projects revolved around: revision of
                  cartographic guidelines for thematic maps including tools in ArcGIS; Web-based mapping and interactive
                  maps with GeoJSON; and Exploratory spatial data analysis.</p>

              <ul>
                <p>The course was dedicated to providing an introduction to data science and machine learning, leading
                  to Artificial Intelligence. It included the concept of geo-spatial with artificial intelligence. The
                  course covered the topic and the emergence of data science as a result of numerous trends colliding
                  (internet of things, digitalization, open data, social media, etc.). It then evaluates the new data's
                  qualities, as well as the data science and machine learning ecosystem's technological and
                  methodological environment.
                </p>
                <p>With this course, I learned how to start a data science project, resolve data analytics concerns, and
                  apply data science to real-world problems through examples and instances. As an understanding of the
                  basis of data science, I along with my team member Tanya Singh perform a task entitled: "Basic
                  Statistical Analysis using RNN for hurrican OPHELIA.". Though we were not able to obtained accurate
                  result, we were happy for being able to perform the task well and enhancing a deeper understanding of
                  the topic. We have documented our scripts <a href="https://pratichhya.github.io/documents/hurricane_dsc.ipynb" target="blank">here</a>.</p>

              <ul>
                <p>This curriculum was introduced to us as a course dedicated to gaining an understanding of 
                  Application Development in an OBIA software environment using Cognition Network Language (CNL) 
                  (eCognition). Throughout the course, we learned about the CNL language and worked through a 
                  variety of applications using it. A wide range of topics related to Object Based Image Analysis 
                  were discussed. As part of the course, we worked in groups of two to create our own GUI as 
                  an eCognition Architect Solution. In my case, I chose a topic of "GUI development for Dwelling 
                  Extraction using Deep Learning approach in eCognition" with a team member based on the knowledge 
                  I gained during my internship.<a href="https://pratichhya.github.io/documents/IP_report.pdf" target="blank">This document</a> contains a summary of our work.

              <ul>
                <p>This course provided us with a thorough understanding of a variety of spatial analytical 
                  techniques as well as the skills needed to apply these techniques expertly to specific problems. 
                  I gained a better understanding of geospatial analysis techniques and am now more familiar with 
                  spatial relationships, interpolation, geostatistics, process modeling, and other related topics. 
                  Throughout the session, I submitted my work as ArcGIS Storymaps on a regular basis. They were

                  that it was a self-paced course using freely available online materials, supervision was 
                  provided via online discussion. With the completion of this course, I gained skills in applying 
                  spatial concepts in image analysis by handling basic technical principles of image segmentation 
                  and object-based classification and validations.</p>

                <p>The course focused on communicating established and upcoming architectures introducing the 
                  conceptual strategies, organizational requirements and legal frameworks for leveraging the 
                  advantages of Open GIS. It provided us with organizational, legal and technical foundation for 
                  accessing, using and delivering geographic information in harmonized spatially enabled 
                  distributed IT- service infrastructures.</p><p>
                  Based on these concepts, I learned how to utilize open, shared GIS resources and developed 
                  my understanding and ability to design and use Open GIS data structures, workflows and processes 
                  leveraging open information repositories.

                <p>The course introduced concepts, research methodologies, and techniques of scientific writing with
                  regards to (GI)Science. With this we were able to get an idea on how to choose the right media to
                  publish results as well as details about the iterative process of peer-review in scientific journals
                  from submitting the manuscript to the final article appearing in print. The whole course is
                  accompanied by exercises in scientific dissemination in the English language.</p>
                <p>With the completion of the course I was able to compose an academic paper entitled <a href="https://Pratichhya.github.io/documents/scientific.pdf" target="blank">"Spatial Concept Matters in Land Administration" </a> 
                  on scientific principles, along with an abstract followed by a

                <p>The course included a review of statistical concepts as well as an introduction to 
                  spatial statistics and geostatistics. Spatial statistics presented methods of point 
                  pattern analysis such as nearest neighbor analysis and kernel density estimation, whereas 
                  geostatistics covered interpolation and estimation methods such as deterministic interpolation 
                  and kriging. In the course, the statistical software R was introduced, and ArcGIS was used 
                  for the practical sessions. With the completion of this course, I gained an understanding of 
                  statistical methods in the context of spatial data, as well as the ability to use R.</p>
