        <h2 style= " text-align: center;">Presenting at European Geosciences Union 2023 </h2><br>
        <div class="blog_container">
            <div  class="column2">
                <p style= " text-align: justify; text-indent: 5%">I was overjoyed when my supervisor, Dennis, suggested that I attend theEuropean Geosciences Union 2023 (EGU 2023) conference. Since joining this job, it would be my first conference, and I felt excited and nervous at the same time. I was supposed to present openEO as a component of the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem in the ESA booth. Despite my nerves, I was determined to make the most of this fantastic opportunity.
            </p></div>
            <div  class="column1">
                <img src="https://Pratichhya.github.io/images/blog/egu.png" width="600" height="350">
            </div><p style= " text-align: justify; text-indent: 5%">As I was preparing for my presentation, I received some wonderful news: I had been selected as one of the panellists for the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem Townhall session. This was a huge deal for me, leaving me scared and more than happy. I wasn't sure if I would be able to do justice to the topic and make my presence worthy of the event. However, I was fortunate to have a great supervisor Dennis, as well as Bram and Jeroen, who were equally supportive and motivating for the session. Their encouragement helped me build confidence, and I was grateful to be a part of such an amazing team.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p style= " text-align: justify; text-indent: 5%">Then the day of the panel session arrived, followed by the day of my presentation. I was fortunate to have my boyfriend there, who was presenting in the Natural Hazard session, and he assured me that I did a great job and that he was proud of me. This feedback boosted my confidence, and I believe that I was able to justify the topic to some extent. Overall, I am glad and happy to have had such a great experience at the conference, thanks to the support of my colleagues and loved ones.
        </p><p style= " text-align: justify; text-indent: 5%">Looking back on my experience attending the EGU conference, it was an enormous event, with more than 15,000 attendees from around the world, each with a connection to GeoScience. There were several parallel sessions going on, each of them focusing on different aspects of this field, and I was fortunate enough to attend a few of them.
        </p>
        <p style= " text-align: justify; text-indent: 5%">One of the sessions I attended was focused on remote sensing for data management, which allowed me to learn more about how different groups handle large spatial datasets. I was fascinated to hear about the various methods that these groups are using to analyse and utilize these datasets, which provided me with valuable insights that I could apply in my work.
        </p>
        <p style= " text-align: justify; text-indent: 5%">Another session that I attended was focused on the development of data space initiatives, not just in Europe but also by NASA. This session was particularly interesting because it gave me a chance to learn more about various platforms that could provide services to decision-makers and general users for their research. It was an excellent opportunity to broaden my understanding of the data space ecosystem and what kinds of services could be included in the OpenEO algorithm plaza.
        </p>
        <p style= " text-align: justify; text-indent: 5%">Finally, I attended several sessions on landslide monitoring using remote sensing datasets, which was an area of particular interest to me. These sessions provided me with valuable insights into the use of remote sensing data for monitoring landslides and the challenges that researchers face in this field.
        </p>
        <p style= " text-align: justify; text-indent: 5%">Overall, attending the EGU conference was a fantastic opportunity for me to broaden my horizons and learn more about different aspects of GeoScience. It was an honor to be part of such a prestigious event, and I am grateful for the experience.
        </p>
        <br><p style= " text-align: center;">Thank you for your time and patience. Be good do good.</p></div>
