        <h2 style= " text-align: center;">Chasing Smiles in Thailand: A Personal Odyssey</h2><br>
        <p style= " text-align: justify; text-indent: 5%">
            I had never been away from home before. I always stayed with my parents until I went to college, and rarely did I spend more than a week away from home. This was my first time staying in a foreign land, surrounded by different people and immersed in a new culture. Although I had previously travelled to India with my mom and spent a week in China, this time it felt like the beginning of a completely new adventure. When I left home, I didn't realise that I would only return for occasional vacations.

            I flew to Thailand for my internship at the Asian Institute of Technology, along with my friend Pramod and my boyfriend who was already working there. I had known him since my first year in engineering, so I wasn't scared at all. In fact, I was incredibly excited and happy to finally leave home and live life on my own terms. I couldn't wait to enjoy fries for breakfast and chips for dinner.
            <br>
            Despite the diverse languages, people, and lifestyles in Thailand, there was a certain sense of familiarity that embraced me. It may be because I had my friends by my side, making everything seem more familiar and comfortable. Moreover, the working environment was pleasant, and I was fortunate to encounter several exceptionally helpful and kind individuals.
            <br>
            One of the challenges I faced was adapting to the vastly different cuisine from what I was used to in Nepal. Initially, it wasn’t easy to navigate the flavours, particularly when I expected something savoury, and it turned out to be sweet. However, as time went on, I grew accustomed to the unique tastes and began to relish them. I developed a strong craving for Thai food, particularly the delectable Pad Thai dish.
            <br>
            The weather in Thailand was starkly different from that of my hometown, Pokhara, but surprisingly, it suited me well. I felt a sense of contentment, confidence, and motivation, which fueled my determination to work even harder. As my internship came to an end, I decided to stay and continue working in this new environment. I am incredibly fortunate to have had a boyfriend who was already familiar with the place and the company. His guidance and support proved invaluable throughout my journey.
            <br>
            I vividly recall the first day of my job, February 4th, 2019. I looked at him and said, "I will work tirelessly, and one day, you will say you are proud of me."
            <br>
            In pursuing life experiences, I cannot say that my time at GIC AIT was great. While I did learn many things and found happiness in those experiences, there came a point where I felt immense fear, worry, and deep depression due to the prevailing politics that surrounded me. Unbeknownst to me and without any personal interest, I was forcefully drawn into this political environment.
            <br>
            All I desired was to work diligently, acquire new knowledge, and maintain a neutral stance. However, this led me to become a target of a project manager who treated me with extreme cruelty. I vividly remember waking up each day with a heavy heart, dreading to go to the office because I knew he would be there, ready to single me out for his malicious intentions. No matter how hard I tried to excel or do something good, his only response would be, "You know how to sell yourself." Initially, when I began my career, I thought it was a compliment, but as he used it to undermine everything I did, it became a constant taunt.
            <br>
            Eventually, I realised that this treatment was unacceptable. However, just as I came to terms with it, the COVID-19 pandemic struck, and we were fortunate enough to transition to remote work. During this challenging period, I was fortunate to have my supportive and encouraging boyfriend by my side, offering unwavering support throughout.
            <br>
            Despite the challenges I faced, I also had numerous positive experiences that continue to bring a smile to my face and fill me with great joy. These experiences have taught me the invaluable lesson of not blindly trusting everyone and recognising that people may only sometimes be as they initially appear.
            <br>
            Being immersed in a multinational environment has significantly enhanced my ability to adapt to various situations and embrace diverse cultures. I am confident that I can thrive in any community with different lifestyles and customs. This working experience served as my introduction to the industry, providing a valuable understanding of how things operate and enabling me to handle situations more professionally. I have also learned the importance of avoiding toxic individuals, as they can be found anywhere, and prioritising my well-being in such circumstances.
            <br>
            Overall I have a missed experience in Thailand, but if I am to relate those only with Thailand then I will say it was one of the important parts of my life. It is such a beautiful place with wonderful, kind and humble people. They always have something or the other to offer to people from every group. I will always admire the kindness of Thai people, the taste of their food and the beauty of nature in Thailand.
            <br>
            Although my experience in Thailand was mixed, if I were to associate those experiences solely with the country itself, I consider it a crucial chapter of my life. Thailand holds a special place in my heart as it is a genuinely captivating destination with its enchanting landscapes and warm-hearted, humble people. The country has something unique for individuals from every walk of life.
            <br>
            I will forever cherish the kindness displayed by the Thai people, who consistently made me feel welcomed and appreciated. The flavours of their cuisine still linger on my taste buds, and I remain in awe of the vibrant and diverse culinary delights the country has to offer. Additionally, Thailand's natural beauty, from its breathtaking beaches to its lush jungles, left an indelible impression on me.
            <br>
            Despite the challenges I faced, I cannot deny Thailand’s overall allure and impact on my life. It is a place that I will always hold in high regard and treasure for its people, food, and the stunning wonders of its natural surroundings.
