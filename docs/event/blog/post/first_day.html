        <h2 style= " text-align: center;">One year in Europe</h2><br>
        <p style= " text-align: justify; text-indent: 5%">I arrived in Europe for the first time exactly a year ago today. I was very excited to come to Europe, a place rich in history and culture that I had always hoped to visit one day and experience a completely different and new environment from Asia, and here I was on September 20th, 2020. I arrived in Vienna after an 8-hour flight from Thailand and traveled to Salzburg, where I would spend a year of my Erasmus program. The scenery reminded me of my childhood home in Nepal, which I sorely missed. I was unable to return home and say my final goodbyes due to the COVID pandemic. Now that Europe would be my home for the next two years of my Master's program, I hoped to immerse myself in the culture of this place.
        </p><p style= " text-align: justify; text-indent: 5%">My conception of Europe was of a continent united as a single European Union, with everyone supporting one another, so meeting people who were culturally diverse but united by a common name was very exciting for me. People told me I looked Indian, which worried me because I enjoy being called a Nepali and believe me, I look Nepali. Yes, I was judged primarily based on my appearance, which bothered me. Yeah of course, I was a typical young Nepalese girl who had never traveled so far from home or stayed alone and it was exciting and scary all at the same time.</p>
        <p style= " text-align: justify; text-indent: 5%">When I arrived in Salzburg, my course friends had planned an evening gathering, and despite my exhaustion, I decided to attend. Unfortunately, my first night in Salzburg (and thus my first night in Europe) was not as pleasant as I had hoped. I was in a different cultural environment, far away from everything I knew, surrounded by completely new people; I was terrified to be here, and I wanted to leave as soon as possible because I didn't know how to figure out anything. Despite the fact that it was overwhelming for me, I was fortunate to be surrounded by supportive friends. Despite the fact that it was overwhelming for me, I was fortunate to have supportive friends around me. Every time I recall my first day in Salzburg, I remember Ella from Ireland, who guided me back home. Perhaps it was a small act of kindness for her, but in a new place, new environment, where I had only arrived a few hours before and everything was so overwhelming, it was a big help. And I think she's feeling a bit shy because I keep bringing it up, hahahha sorry Ella but you're really nice to me and thank you again.</p>
        <p style= " text-align: justify; text-indent: 5%">It's been a year, and I'm writing from a different place in Europe today. I've moved to Vannes in France, for my second year of the Erasmus master's program, and I'm so glad I made this decision to come to Europe. Not only did this one year teach me a lot about my studies, but it also taught me a lot about myself. I learned about life values, culture, language, kindness, patience, and a variety of other things. Today, I believe that wherever I go in the world, I will find my way and be able to adapt to any situation. Yes, I will wonder and be scared, and it may be overwhelming for me, but I now believe I can.</p>
        <p style= " text-align: justify; text-indent: 5%">This continent is rich in history, culture, kindness, knowledge and many other things. They have preserved both natural and historical facts, which is very commendable. People here, love the way they are and are proud to be themselves. It’s been a long time away from home, many times I miss home, I miss festivals, Nepali food and I miss Nepal the most but Europe has done a lot for me to make me feel at home. I am happy to be in Europe and around people of the World. I am proud of myself and my decision to be here.</p>
