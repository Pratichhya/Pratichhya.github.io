        <h2 style= " text-align: center;">Being a vegetarian</h2><br>
        <p style= " text-align: justify; text-indent: 5%"><b>“Yeah, I am Vegetarian”</b> I am sure this is the phrase that I have as much as the phrase “I am Pratichhya”. I've been a vegetarian for more than ten years and am very proud of myself. But, most of the time, when I meet a non-vegetarian, I have to convince them that I am happy being a vegetarian. Sometimes it's humorous, but it irritates me a lot of the time, especially when they act start calling me "grass eater."
        </p><p style= " text-align: justify; text-indent: 5%">People often assume I am a vegetarian because I am Hindu, which makes sense. But sadly, it is not because of my religion; in fact, being a vegetarian in Nepal is difficult, especially in a family that enjoys eating meat. I used to love eating meat, and when I had to give it up because my mother became a vegetarian, I couldn't stand it for long and began eating more meat. After a few years, I decided to give up because I witnessed how they killed a buffalo, which was terrifying. As a Nepalese, I had witnessed goat slaughter every Dashain (Hindu Festival), and despite my sadness, I couldn't stop eating it, which was yummy back then. But I realized it was very harsh how they killed a buffalo and that killing is cruel no matter what animal you are. So, since 8th grade, I've avoided eating anything with faces. It doesn't make me proud to admit that I eat eggs, but yeap, I have been an egg-eating vegetarian for over ten years.</p>
        <p style= " text-align: justify; text-indent: 5%">The journey was not as easy as I now believe. Although my mother was always supportive of this, it used to be a problem at every family gathering because they had to prepare a separate special vegetarian dish for me. It became more difficult when I began travelling, particularly in China and Thailand. During my stay in Thailand, I mostly avoided eating outside of places I was familiar with because it was difficult for me to explain that I am a vegetarian who does not eat seafood because they believe seafood is vegetarian. I enjoyed eating out in India because there are so many options, and they are so much cheaper than non-veg foods. And since I've been to Europe, it hasn't been too difficult because most of them have a dedicated section for vegetarians. In fact, I have started eating Thai food a lot (Tofu Pad Thai is my favourite).</p>
        <p style= " text-align: justify; text-indent: 5%">Some questions I'm sure most vegetarians like me have faced are about how we get protein or the proper diet needed, which I think is a valid concern, so I respond with a list of food items that are higher in protein and vitamins than meat products. It's funny to me when people ask if it's okay for them to eat meat in front of me; it's very kind of them to ask because not all vegetarians are as chill as me; who doesn't care unless you touch my food with your meaty spoon. However, some people can be extremely rude, as I have encountered a number of people who advised me not to waste money on canteen potatoes and instead to try the green grasses outside the canteen. It irritates me because I never force or advise people to eat vegetarian because it is their choice, and I never say why don't you directly bite off the neck of a chicken that could be more fresh? Even though it feels great to be a vegetarian, there have been times when I, and even some of my vegetarian friends, have felt isolated, as the odd ones out. It used to bother me when I was in Thailand, but now I know why I'm being excluded, so it doesn't bother me anymore. To be honest, European are very, very supportive of this I never felt bad or weird being vegetarian among them.</p>
        <p style= " text-align: justify; text-indent: 5%">We are given the freedom to make our own choices, including meals. So, I don't recommend or force anyone to be vegetarian or non-vegetarian. I just wanted to express how relieved I am that I am not eating an animal that I see walking next to me. I am not contributing to any killings, which motivates me to be a vegetarian, knowing that someone is living a little longer because of me.</p>
