        <h2 style= " text-align: center;">Being a part of EMCDE…GeoDsc</h2><br>
        <p style= " text-align: justify; text-indent: 5%">I wanted to study more, much more than a bachelor in engineering. I was in a good place, having a good job, learning many things, growing my network but in this big bright career, I always felt a small tiny dark space. This gloomy void kept reminding me that I needed to study more, that I needed to progress academically, and that if I did, I would be more confident.

        </p><p style= " text-align: justify; text-indent: 5%">I was working as a research associate in the Geoinformatics Center (GIC) of the Asian Institute of Technology since 4 February 2019. The centre has great expertise in the field of remote sensing and GIS. Initially, I was recruited as a part of a project "Implementation of Integrated Geospatial Platform, Database, and Applications for Disaster Risk Management in Uttarakhand " funded by the World Bank. Followed by this I worked in several project for GIC until 15 August 2020. It seems to be a small period but trust me, I learned as much as half of my life. When I say half of my life, it sounds so old, yet I was the youngest at the time I worked there. It was a wonderful time there and I didn't expect to leave the place any soon but I knew to contribute more, develop confidence in myself and make it count for what work I do I have to go for higher studies. 
        
        </p><p style= " text-align: justify; text-indent: 5%">It was Ashok Dahal, who once mentioned to me about Erasmus Mundus Joint Master Program. Before this, I knew nothing about Master in Copernicus Digital Earth and when learned about it I didn’t think I am qualified for this. The course work was vast and covered emerging topics. I was scared that if I got lost in these enormous themes, I wouldn't be able to perform adequately. On top of that, I hadn't prepared for TOFEL and wasn't sure if I wanted to leave GIC so soon. The course looked incredibly interesting, so I decided to give it a shot. I applied for it with Geodata Science specialization. I sincerely hoped to be selected, but I couldn't help but question, "Why would they choose me when I'm not very talented in this area and don't have a high TOFEL score?".
        </p><p style= " text-align: justify; text-indent: 5%">“The Selection Committee has assessed your complete application documents and it’s our pleasure to inform you that you have been selected as Erasmus+ EMJMD scholar for the ‘Copernicus Master in Digital Earth’ programme”. I received this email few weeks later and was delighted to see this message. I was overjoyed, and it wasn't until later that I realized my interview had gone well, and I believe they thought I deserved it. It is great to know that they have faith in me, and it gives me the courage to start afresh and give my best to every task I am assigned.</p>
        <img src="https://Pratichhya.github.io/images/blog/erasmus.jpg" alt="Selection" width="80%">
        <p style= " text-align: justify; text-indent: 5%">Despite the fact that the story is over a year ago, I can still remember how happy I was when I received the email. Today, here I am, learnt a lot of new things, met a lot of new people, and I feel like I've gained a lot of confidence in myself. Academically and psychologically, I have grown. At this moment, I can confidently assert to myself that I am capable. And I'm all set to begin my specialized track. </p>
        <p style= " text-align: justify; text-indent: 5%">My message to everyone reading this and wondering to choose whether or not pursue CDE is: if you genuinely love this domain and are ready of handling innovative geospatial work, then jump in and give it your all. Be down to earth, yet monitoring from up.</p>
    <br><p style= " text-align: center;">Thank you for your time and patience. Be good do good.</p></div>
